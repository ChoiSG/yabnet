Agent Design 

[ Generator ]
Brainstorming 

Create an agent based on the configuration file 
	- server ip address 
	- server port 

Use string template? 

Or a yaml? 
Or cmd? - Too much work, doesn't really need to tbh 


[ Freezer ] 

Create a freezed agent using pyinstaller 
	- pyinstaller needs to be installed in the master server 
	- 

[ Agent ]

It'll be nice if it has basic persistence based on the target machine's architecture (*Nix, Windows) 

Basic agent 

If it's created through go, that'll be dope 
	- Might be a lighter 
		- Given pyinstaller is very heavy
